## 📌 Looking for the latest versions?

Active maintenance, errata correction, and version increments (including
DOI-bearing versions) occur via **Zenodo**.

Any later versions are **derivative** of the fixed artifacts preserved in
this repository.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository is **archival in nature**.

It exists to:
- Preserve finalized methodological research documents
- Anchor cryptographic provenance using SHA-256 hashes
- Provide a public verification surface via GitHub and Internet Archive

It is **not intended** for collaborative development.
Issues, pull requests, and forks are not expected or required.

---

## Scope and Status

This repository constitutes the **canonical public release record** for
two methodological research documents issued on **January 18, 2026**.

All documents contained here are **fixed artifacts** corresponding to
that release date.

---

## 📄 Documents Included

### **SF0038 — Ingestion Verification Protocol (IVP) v2.6**

A platform-agnostic methodological protocol defining a verifiable process
for document ingestion by AI systems.

IVP replaces implicit assumptions of “reading” or “understanding” with
explicit, observable processing requirements, including:
- Active summarization checkpoints
- External adjudication of ingestion adequacy
- Clear failure modes and prohibited shortcuts
- Explicit constraints on automation and AI–AI delegation

---

### **SF0039 — Context Representation Drift (CRD) v1.3**

A conceptual and methodological analysis identifying **Context
Representation Drift** as a distinct degradation phenomenon in extended
AI interactions.

CRD formalizes patterns often misattributed to hallucination or forgetting
and explains their impact on:
- Long-horizon reasoning
- Document ingestion reliability
- Multi-turn and delegated AI workflows

---

## Relationship Between the Documents

- **IVP (SF0038)** establishes verified starting conditions for document
  ingestion.
- **CRD (SF0039)** describes degradation dynamics that emerge over time
  even after verified ingestion.

Together, they form a coherent methodological foundation for designing,
auditing, and evaluating reliable AI-assisted research workflows.

## 🔐 Provenance and Verification

This repository includes cryptographic provenance artifacts:

- **Claim of Origin**  
  Declares authorship and first public release, recording SHA-256 hashes
  of the released PDFs.

- **OpenTimestamps proof (.ots)**  
  Enables independent, third-party verification of the release timestamp.

The provenance files establish **immutable priority of authorship** for
this release.

---

## Internet Archive

A permanent archival mirror of this release, including provenance files,
is available on the Internet Archive:

- **Synthience Institute Research Methods Release — January 18, 2026**
