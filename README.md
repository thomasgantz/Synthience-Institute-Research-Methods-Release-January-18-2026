## 📌 Looking for the latest versions?

Active maintenance, errata correction, metadata updates, and DOI-bearing
versions occur via **Zenodo**.

Any later versions are **derivative** of the fixed artifacts preserved in
this repository.

### Canonical Publications (DOI)

The following **canonical DOIs** always resolve to the latest public
versions of each document:

- **Ingestion Verification Protocol (IVP)**  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18289047

- **Context Representation Drift (CRD)**  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18289391

Version-specific DOIs represent historical snapshots and are retained
solely for citation lineage and provenance continuity.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository is **archival in nature**.

It exists to:
- Preserve finalized methodological research documents
- Anchor cryptographic provenance using SHA-256 hashes
- Provide a public verification surface via GitHub and Internet Archive

It is **not intended** for collaborative development.
Issues, pull requests, and forks are not expected or required.

---

## Scope and Status

This repository constitutes the **canonical public release record** for
two methodological research documents issued on **January 18, 2026**.

All documents contained here are **fixed artifacts** corresponding
exactly to that release date.

---

## 📄 Documents Included

### **SF0038 — Ingestion Verification Protocol (IVP) v2.6**

**Canonical DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18289047

A platform-agnostic methodological protocol defining a verifiable process
for document ingestion by AI systems.

IVP replaces implicit assumptions of “reading” or “understanding” with
explicit, observable processing requirements, including:
- Active summarization checkpoints
- External adjudication of ingestion adequacy
- Clear failure modes and prohibited shortcuts
- Explicit constraints on automation and AI–AI delegation

---

### **SF0039 — Context Representation Drift (CRD) v1.3**

**Canonical DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18289391

A conceptual and methodological analysis identifying **Context
Representation Drift** as a distinct degradation phenomenon in extended
AI interactions.

CRD formalizes patterns often misattributed to hallucination or forgetting
and explains their impact on:
- Long-horizon reasoning
- Document ingestion reliability
- Multi-turn and delegated AI workflows

---

## Relationship Between the Documents

- **IVP (SF0038)** establishes verified starting conditions for document
  ingestion.
- **CRD (SF0039)** describes degradation dynamics that emerge over time
  even after verified ingestion.

Together, they form a coherent methodological foundation for designing,
auditing, and evaluating reliable AI-assisted research workflows.

## 🔐 Claim of Origin and Provenance

**Claim of Origin (COO)**  
Synthience Institute  
Author: **Thomas W. Gantz**  
Date of Initial Public Release: **2026-01-18**

This release asserts authorship and first public release provenance for
the following research documents published by the Synthience Institute.

Any later versions incorporating DOIs, metadata changes, or formatting
updates are **derivative** of the files listed below.

This claim does **not** assert DOI assignment, peer review status, or
publication venue.
